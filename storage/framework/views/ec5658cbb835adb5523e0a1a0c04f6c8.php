<h3>
Series setting In Jujutsu Kaisen, all living beings emanate Cursed Energy (Japanese: 呪力 Juryoku), which arises from negative emotions that naturally flow through the body. Normal people cannot control this flow in their bodies, and as a result, they constan
tly lose Cursed Energy, giving rise to Curses (Japanese: 呪い Noroi).
Jujutsu Charmers (Japanese: 呪術師 Jujutsu-shi; lit. "Masters of the Cursed Technique" or "Shamans") are people who control the flow of Cursed Energy in their bodies, allowing them to use it as they wish and reduce its release. 
High-ranking Casters and Cursers can refine this energy and use it to perform Jujutsu Techniques (Japanese: 呪術式 Jujutsu-shiki) unique to the user or his or her family. Its advanced form is Domain Expansion (Japanese: 領域展開 Ryōiki tenkai), 
which allows the user to use their Cursed Energy to build a pocket dimension covering the surrounding area where all attacks will be stronger.
